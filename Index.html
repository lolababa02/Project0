          My name is Sope Lanlehin. I was born in 1989 in London, in the UK and I started
playing the Piano when I was 7 yrs old.

I had the opportunity to attend my 1st jazz concert when I was 12 and fell absolutely
in love with the genre that day and what was possible
on the piano.
          </p>
          <p class="maintext">
Ever since then I have developed my technique and my personal sound by taking college Music Jazz
courses, watching youtube videos, attending Jazz clubs, studying classical pieces and jazz standards.

I hope to inspire young musicians and share the joy that comes from truly loving the instrument.
          </p>
